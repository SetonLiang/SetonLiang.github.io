Hi!üëã My name is Zhuowen Liang (Ê¢ÅÂçìÊñá), I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Data Intelligence and Analytics Lab](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/), [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Nan Tang](https://nantang.github.io).
I received my bachelor degree from School of Computer Science & Engineering, [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn) in 2025. 
I used to be a research assistant in [HKUST-CIVAL group](https://hkust-cival.com/) at HKUST(GZ), advised by Prof. [Wei Zeng](https://zeng-wei.com/).


My current research lies on **Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG)**, **Document Intelligence**, and **Information Extraction**, with an emphasis on transforming large collections of unstructured documents into structured and queryable data. I am also very interested in research fields including **Reinforcement Learning**, LLM-Based Agent, and Data mining.

<!-- am exploring graph based RAG assisted with Large Language Models to support scientific literature QA tasks.  -->

You can find my CV here: [Zhuowen Liang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/ZhuowenLiang_CV.pdf).
