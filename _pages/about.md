I am Zhuowen Liang, a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology at South China University of Technology[(SCUT)](https://www.scut.edu.cn). Now I am a research assistant in [Data Intelligence and Analytics Lab](https://github.com/HKUSTDial/) at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Nan Tang](https://nantang.github.io/). Previously, I joined [HKUST-CIVAL group](https://hkust-cival.com/) at HKUST(GZ), advised by Prof. [Wei Zeng](https://zeng-wei.com/).


My current research lies on Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) and Data-Centric AI. I used to leverage knowledge graph to enhance RA-LLMs for multifaceted literature analysis and currently explore the Structured Reasoning combined with RAG. I am also very interested in research fields including Data Mining, Database, Machine Learning and Multimodal Alignment.

<!-- am exploring graph based RAG assisted with Large Language Models to support scientific literature QA tasks.  -->

You can find my CV here: [Zhuowen Liang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Zhuowen Liang_CV.pdf).
