I am Zhuowen Liang, a final year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [SCUT](https://www.scut.edu.cn). I am also doing research assistant in the [HKUST-CIVAL group](https://hkust-cival.com/) at HKUST(GZ), supervised by Prof. [Wei Zeng](https://zeng-wei.com/).

My current research is on Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG). I am exploring graph based RAG assisted with Large Language Models to support scientific literature QA tasks. I am also very interested in research fields inlcuding Data Mining, Database, Machine Learning and Multimodal Deep-Learning.

You can find my CV here: [Zhuowen Liang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Zhuowen Liang_CV.pdf).
